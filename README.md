## Description
The MNIST dataset, which stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, consists of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. It can be easily imported from Keras Datasets using the command "from keras.datasets import mnist" for the purpose of classifying these images into their corresponding digit classes.

To compile the file:
```
javac MicroP.java
```

To run the file:
```
java MicroP
```
